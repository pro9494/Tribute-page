						Who Was Tupac Shakur?</h2>
                     <p> Tupac Shakur was an American rapper and actor<br>
					  who came to embody the 1990s gangsta-rap aesthetic,<br> 
                      and who in death became an icon symbolizing noble<br>
					  struggle. He has sold 75 million albums to date,<br>
                      making him one of the top-selling artists of all <br>
					  time.</p>

                      <p>A sensitive, precociously talented and troubled soul,<br>
					  Tupac was gunned down in Las Vegas on September 7, <br>
                       1996 and died six days later.<br>
                         His murder has never been solved.</p>

								<p>Tupac began his music career as a rebel <br>
                                  with a cause to articulate the travails <br>
                                   and injustices endured by many African <br>
                                  Americans. His skill in doing so made him <br>
                                  a spokesperson not just for his own <br>
                                   generation but for subsequent ones who<br>
                                     continue to face the same struggle for <br>
                                        equality.</p>

									<p>In life, his biggest battle was sometimes<br>
                                      with himself. As fate drove him towards <br>
                                       the nihilism of gangsta rap, <br>
                                       and into the arms of the controversial<br>
                                        Death Row Records impresario Suge Knight, <br>
                                         the boundaries between Shakur's art and his<br>
                                         life became increasingly blurred — with tragic<br>
                                           consequences.</p>

						Early Life</h2>
                   <p>  Tupac was born on June 16, 1971, in Harlem,<br>
					 New York. His mother, Afeni, was raising two <br>
					 children on her own and struggled for money. <br>
					 The family moved homes often, sometimes staying<br>
					 in shelters.</p>

                       <p> They moved to Baltimore, where Tupac<br>
                          enrolled at the prestigious Baltimore <br>
                          School for the Arts, at which he felt <br>
                            "the freest I ever felt."</p>


                             <p> Tupac’s Mom, Father and Sister<br>
                               Tupac was named Lesane Parish <br>
                                Crooks at birth. After joining <br>
                                  the Black Panther party, his mother<br> 
                                 changed his first name to Tupac Amaru,<br>
                                a Peruvian revolutionary who was killed <br>
                                by the Spanish. Tupac later took his surname<br> 
                             from his sister’s Sekiya's father, another<br>
                               Panther called Mutulu Shakur.</p>

                              <p> Tupac’s mother, Alice Faye Williams, <br>
                                was the daughter of a North Carolina <br>
                                 maid and a high-school dropout. She <br>
                                  became pregnant with Tupac in 1970 <br>
                                   while on bail after being charged with<br>
                                      conspiring to set off a race war. Afeni<br>
                                       was acquitted the following year after<br>
                                        successfully defending herself in court,<br>
                                         displaying a gift for oration that her son <br>
                                          would inherit.</p>

                                      <p>  She changed her name to Afeni Shakur after <br>
                                          becoming actively involved with the Black <br>
                                            Panther Party. Afeni died in May 2016 at the<br> 
                                             age of 69.</p>

                                          <p>  Tupac's father, Billy Garland, was also a <br>
                                           Panther but lost contact with Afeni when <br>
                                          Tupac was five years old. The rapper would <br>
                                         not see his father again until he was 23. <br>
                                          "I thought my father was dead all my life,<br>
                                          " he told the writer Kevin Powell during an <br>
                                             interview with Vibe magazine in 1996. <br>
                                               "I felt I needed a daddy to show me the <br>
                                                  ropes and I didn't have one."</p>

                                             <p>  Afeni gave birth to a daughter, Sekiya,<br>
                                             two years after Tupac. However, Sekiya’s <br>
                                               father, Mutulu Shakur, did not stick around, either.</p>

                                            <p> Jada Pinkett Smith and Tupac’s Friendship<br>
                                         Tupac met actress Jada Pinkett-Smith in high <br>
                                    school at the Baltimore School for the Arts in<br>
                                Maryland. She had a cameo in his music video for <br>
                             'Strictly 4 My Niggaz.'</p>

                              <p>   Pinkett-Smith was featured in the 2017 movie on<br>
                                   Tupac All Eyez on Me. She later told reporters<br>
                                     that she was a drug dealer when she met Tupac <br>
                                      and that she found the “reimagining” of their <br>
                                        relationship in the film “very hurtful.”</p>

                                  <p>   "It wasn't just about, oh, you have this cute girl,<br>
                                           and this cool guy, they must have been in this — nah,<br> 
                                             it wasn't that at all. It was about survival, <br>
                                          and it had always been about survival between us," she said.</p>

					    <h2 class="heading1">Move to California and Rise to Fame</h2>
                                         Tupac’s Baltimore neighborhood was riven by crime,<br> 
                                               so the family moved to Marin City, California. <br>
                                             It turned out to be a "mean little ghetto," <br>
                                            according to Robert Sam Anison's comprehensive<br>
                                           posthumous feature on Tupac for Vanity Fair in 1997.<br>
                                           It was in Marin City that Afeni succumbed to crack <br>
                                            addiction — a drug her son, Tupac, would sell on the<br>
                                              same streets where his mother bought her supply.</p>

                                              <p> Tupac's love for hip hop would steer him away from a <br>
                                             life of crime (for a while, at least). At 17, in the <br>
                                           spring of 1989, he met an older white woman, Leila<br>
                                            Steinberg, in a park. They struck up a conversation<br>
												about Winnie Mandela. Steinberg would later recall <br>
												"a young man with fan-like eyelashes, overflowing <br>
                                                  charisma, and the most infectious laugh."</p>

                                             <p> By the time they met, Tupac was obsessively writing<br>
                                                 poetry and convinced Steinberg, who had no <br>
                                                  music-industry experience, to become his manager.</p>

                                                  <p> Steinberg was eventually able to get Tupac in front <br>
                                                      of music manager Atron Gregory, who secured a gig <br>
                                                        for him in 1990 as a roadie and dancer for the hip hop<br>
                                                           group Digital Underground. He soon stepped up to the mic, <br>
                                                             making his recording debut in 1991 on Same Song, which <br>
                                                          soundtracked the Dan Aykroyd comedy Nothing but Trouble.<br>
                                                        Tupac also appeared on Digital Underground's album Sons <br>
